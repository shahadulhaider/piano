## Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Audio Engine (Week 1)
**Goal**: Build the foundation audio system with low latency and high quality

- [ ] Set up Web Audio API context and audio graph
- [ ] Implement polyphonic audio synthesis system (10+ simultaneous notes)
- [ ] Integrate high-quality piano samples (Salamander Grand Piano or similar)
- [ ] Implement multi-velocity layers (5-7 zones: ppp to fff)
- [ ] Add ADSR envelope control for natural note articulation
- [ ] Implement audio buffer pooling for performance
- [ ] Add basic reverb and EQ processing
- [ ] Optimize for <10ms audio latency
- [ ] Create audio engine store (Zustand) for audio state

**Deliverable**: Working audio engine that plays piano notes with velocity sensitivity

### Phase 2: Keyboard Input System (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Robust input handling for both computer and MIDI keyboards

- [ ] Implement QWERTY keyboard mapping (2+ octave range)
- [ ] Add polyphonic key detection (prevent ghosting)
- [ ] Implement velocity detection from keypress dynamics
- [ ] Add Web MIDI API support for external keyboards
- [ ] Implement sustain pedal support (spacebar + MIDI CC64)
- [ ] Add keyboard input store (Zustand)
- [ ] Create custom hooks: `useKeyboardInput`, `useMIDIInput`
- [ ] Handle edge cases (key repeat, focus loss, etc.)

**Deliverable**: Full keyboard input with MIDI support

---

### Phase 3: Visual Piano UI (Week 2)
**Goal**: Beautiful, responsive piano keyboard interface

- [ ] Create Piano component with 88 keys (A0-C8)
- [ ] Implement canvas/SVG rendering for smooth 60fps animation
- [ ] Add active note visualization with velocity-based colors
- [ ] Implement touch support for mobile (multi-touch polyphony)
- [ ] Add key labels (note names, QWERTY mappings) - toggleable
- [ ] Create zoom/scroll controls for octave focusing
- [ ] Make fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Optimize rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Dark/light theme support

**Deliverable**: Interactive visual piano keyboard

---

### Phase 4: Professional Features (Week 3)
**Goal**: Add professional-grade controls and features

- [ ] Implement octave shifting (+/- 4 octaves)
- [ ] Add transpose control (-12 to +12 semitones)
- [ ] Create metronome with tempo control (20-300 BPM)
- [ ] Add recording & playback functionality
- [ ] Implement MIDI file export
- [ ] Add multiple piano models (Grand, Upright, Electric)
- [ ] Tuning control (A=432Hz, 440Hz, 442Hz)
- [ ] Expression controls (mod wheel, pitch bend)
- [ ] Create settings panel with persistence

**Deliverable**: Full-featured professional piano

---

### Phase 5: PWA Implementation (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Make the app installable and work offline

- [ ] Install and configure Vite PWA plugin
- [ ] Create service worker with caching strategy
- [ ] Implement offline-first approach for audio samples
- [ ] Add progressive sample loading (cache on first play)
- [ ] Create manifest.json with app metadata
- [ ] Add install prompts (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Implement app update notifications
- [ ] Cache static assets (cache-first strategy)
- [ ] Use IndexedDB for user preferences and recordings
- [ ] Test offline functionality thoroughly

**Deliverable**: Fully functional PWA

---

### Phase 6: Mobile Optimization (Week 4)
**Goal**: Exceptional mobile experience

- [ ] Optimize touch zones for small screens
- [ ] Implement gesture controls (swipe for octave, pinch to zoom)
- [ ] Add landscape mode optimization for tablets
- [ ] Adaptive sample quality for device capabilities
- [ ] Optimize for mobile audio latency
- [ ] Fullscreen mode for immersive experience
- [ ] Hardware acceleration for rendering
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile

**Deliverable**: Production-ready mobile experience

---

### Phase 7: Advanced Audio Features (Week 5)
**Goal**: Studio-quality sound and realism

- [ ] Implement sympathetic resonance simulation
- [ ] Add release samples for authentic note endings
- [ ] Pedal noise samples for realism
- [ ] Multiple microphone positions (close, mid, far)
- [ ] Convolution reverb with room simulation
- [ ] Advanced EQ and compression
- [ ] Dynamic range control
- [ ] Web Audio API optimizations

**Deliverable**: Professional studio-quality audio

---

### Phase 8: Polish & Performance (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Production-ready optimization

- [ ] Performance audit and optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization (<500KB initial)
- [ ] Code splitting for lazy loading
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for all features
- [ ] Create tutorial/help overlay
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Analytics integration (optional)

**Deliverable**: Polished, production-ready app

---

### Phase 9: Documentation & Deployment (Week 6)
**Goal**: Deploy and document

- [ ] Write comprehensive README
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Create demo video/screenshots
- [ ] Submit to PWA directories

**Deliverable**: Live, documented, deployed application

## Key Technical Decisions

### Audio Architecture
- **Web Audio API** for low-latency synthesis
- **Sample-based playback** with velocity layers
- **Audio Worklet** for processing (if needed)
- **Buffer pooling** for memory efficiency

### State Management
- **Zustand** stores:
  - `useAudioStore`: Audio engine state
  - `useKeyboardStore`: Input state
  - `useSettingsStore`: User preferences
  - `useRecordingStore`: Recording/playback state

### Performance Targets
- Audio latency: <10ms
- Visual latency: <16.67ms (60fps)
- Initial load: <2s on 3G
- Bundle size: <500KB (excluding samples)

### Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile Safari iOS 14+
- Chrome Mobile 90+
